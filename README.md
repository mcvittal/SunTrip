Determine a weather forecast along a route using Google Directions API.

This tool is very much still in beta. Sometime it will get a nice front end. 

If you want to test it, you'll need to get a Google Directions API key as well
as a forecast.io key. 

Both of these keys should go into a file named api_key.py. This file will have
two variables: directions_api_key and weather_api_key. The file isn't synced to
github because I don't want my API keys abused.
